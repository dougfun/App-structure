1. **Author Model**: Represents the authors who write the blog posts. Fields include:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for each author.
    - `name`: The name of the author (required).
    - `email`: The email address of the author.
    - `bio`: A short biography of the author.
    - `photo`: A photo of the author.
    - `posts`: A list of posts written by the author.

2. **Category Model**: Represents the different categories that a blog post can belong to. Fields include:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for each category.
    - `name`: The name of the category (required and unique).
    - `slug`: A URL-friendly identifier for the category (required and unique).
    - `posts`: A list of posts that belong to this category.

3. **Comment Model**: Represents the comments that users leave on a blog post. Fields include:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for each comment.
    - `name`: The name of the person who made the comment (required).
    - `email`: The email address of the person who made the comment (required).
    - `comment`: The content of the comment (required).
    - `post`: The post that the comment is associated with.

4. **Post Model**: Represents the blog posts themselves. Fields include:
    - `id`: A unique identifier for each post.
    - `title`: The title of the blog post (required).
    - `slug`: A URL-friendly identifier for the blog post (required and unique).
    - `excerpt`: A short summary or preview of the blog post (required).
    - `content`: The full content of the blog post (required and rich text).
    - `featured_image`: The main image for the blog post (required).
    - `featured`: A boolean field indicating whether the post is featured or not (required).
    - `author`: A reference to the Author model. Each post will be associated with one author.
    - `categories`: A reference to the Category model. Each post can be associated with one or more categories.

**Study Case Scenarios**:

1. **Creating a New Blog Post**: When an author wants to create a new blog post, they would first create a new entry in the Post model. They would fill out the title, slug, excerpt, content, and featured image fields, and select whether the post is featured or not. They would then link the post to their author profile and select the appropriate categories.

2. **Commenting on a Blog Post**: When a user wants to leave a comment on a blog post, they would create a new entry in the Comment model. They would fill out the name, email, and comment fields, and link the comment to the appropriate blog post.

3. **Browsing Blog Posts by Category**: When a user wants to browse blog posts by category, they would select a category from the Category model. The application would then display all blog posts linked to that category.

4. **Viewing an Author's Blog Posts**: When a user wants to view all blog posts by a particular author, they would select an author from the Author model. The application would then display all blog posts linked to that author.

This is a high-level overview and the actual implementation might require additional considerations such as data validation, error handling, and optimization for performance.
